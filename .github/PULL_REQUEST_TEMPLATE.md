## Testing Approach
<!-- Describe how you tested your changes -->

### Integration Tests Consideration
- [ ] I have considered using integration tests with Testcontainers for this change
- [ ] I have added/updated integration tests for this change
- [ ] I am using mocks instead of integration tests

**If using mocks, please explain why integration tests were not appropriate:**
<!-- 
Examples of valid reasons:
- Testing pure business logic without external dependencies
- External service cannot be easily containerized
- Testing error conditions difficult to reproduce with real dependencies
- Performance-critical unit tests

See CONTRIBUTING.md for full guidance on when mocks are acceptable.
