# Tasks

## Preparation

- [x] **Step 1 — Sync default branch:** `git fetch origin main` and confirm `origin/main` is current (done during propose)
- [x] **Step 2 — Create and publish working branch:** `git worktree add .worktrees/wire-roll-validator-client-712 -b wire-roll-validator-client-712 origin/main` then `git push -u origin wire-roll-validator-client-712` (done during propose)

## Preflight

- [ ] **Verify `pr-review-toolkit:review-pr` is available** — check the available skills list for `pr-review-toolkit:review-pr`. If the skill is not listed, halt immediately, inform the user that the plugin is required, provide installation guidance, and do not proceed until the user confirms it is installed.

## Execution

- [ ] **Issue lifecycle: mark in-progress** — run `gh issue edit 712 --add-label "in-progress"` (repo `dougis-org/session-combat`). Then discover the GitHub Project linked to the repo (`gh project list --owner dougis-org --format json`), resolve the status field option semantically matching "In Progress" (`gh project field-list <project-number> --owner dougis-org --format json`), and move the project item via `gh project item-edit`. If no project item is found, log a warning and continue. If the `gh` token lacks the `project` scope, surface a message instructing the user to run `gh auth refresh -s project` and skip the project-item update (issue label update still proceeds).
- [ ] **Write failing unit tests first (TDD)** in `tests/unit/lib/dice/useRollSubmission.test.ts`, one per rejection scenario in `specs/roll-submission-validation/spec.md`:
  - oversized `formula` (`MAX_FORMULA_LENGTH + 1` chars) → `'error'`, `fetch` not called
  - oversized `rolls` array (`MAX_DICE_IN_ROLL + 1` entries) → `'error'`, `fetch` not called
  - out-of-range die value (e.g. `101`, and separately `0`) → `'error'`, `fetch` not called
  - out-of-range `total` (`MAX_TOTAL_MAGNITUDE + 1` and `-(MAX_TOTAL_MAGNITUDE + 1)`) → `'error'`, `fetch` not called
  - Confirm each new test fails against current `lib/dice/useRollSubmission.ts` (red) before implementing
- [ ] **Add boundary happy-path unit tests** in the same file:
  - max-pool-shaped payload (`MAX_DICE_IN_ROLL` dice at `MAX_DIE_VALUE`, `total` within `MAX_TOTAL_MAGNITUDE`) → still resolves per existing status mapping, `fetch` is called
  - `d%`-shaped payload (`formula: 'd%'`, single `rolls` entry in `1..100`) → still resolves per existing status mapping, `fetch` is called
- [ ] **Implement the validation gate** in `lib/dice/useRollSubmission.ts`: import `rollSubmissionSchema` from `@/lib/validation/rollSubmission` (reuse — no new constants); at the top of `submitRoll`, `safeParse({ formula, rolls, total, visibility })` and `return 'error'` immediately on failure, before the existing `try`/`fetch` block (design Decision 1 & 3). Do not add a `label` parameter (design Decision 2).
- [ ] Run the new and existing tests; confirm all pass (green) and no existing test in `tests/unit/lib/dice/useRollSubmission.test.ts` needed a behavior change
- [ ] Confirm acceptance criteria in `specs/roll-submission-validation/spec.md` are covered by the tests above

## Pre-Commit Code Review

- [ ] **Before every commit**, spawn a dedicated sub-agent to run the `openspec-review-code` skill against `lib/dice/useRollSubmission.ts` and its test file. The primary agent must automatically apply all clearly-correct findings directly to the code — without stopping, without presenting the findings list to the user, and without asking for confirmation. Apply fixes, re-run tests to confirm they pass, then proceed to commit.

## Validation

- [ ] Run unit/integration tests: `node node_modules/.bin/jest tests/unit/lib/dice/useRollSubmission.test.ts`
- [ ] Run E2E tests (if applicable) — not applicable; no E2E coverage touches this hook
- [ ] Run type checks: `npm run type-check` (or project's documented type-check script)
- [ ] Run build: `npm run build`
- [ ] Run security/code quality checks required by project standards (Verity gate / Codacy, per repo config)
- [ ] All completed tasks marked as complete
- [ ] All steps in [Remote push validation]

## Remote push validation

Before running, determine whether the current change is **docs-only**: run `git diff --name-only origin/main...HEAD` and check whether every changed file ends in `.md`. This change touches `lib/dice/useRollSubmission.ts` (not `.md`), so the **full path** applies.

**Full path:**

- **Unit tests** — `node node_modules/.bin/jest` (full suite); all tests must pass
- **Integration tests** — run the project's integration test suite; all tests must pass
- **Regression / E2E tests** — run the project's end-to-end or regression test suite; all tests must pass
- **Build** — `npm run build`; build must succeed with no errors

If **ANY** required step fails, iterate and fix before pushing.

## PR and Merge

- [ ] Ensure the `openspec-review-code` sub-agent was run and all findings were automatically addressed before the final commit
- [ ] Commit all changes to the working branch and push to remote
- [ ] Open PR from `wire-roll-validator-client-712` to `main`. PR body **must** include `Closes #712`.
- [ ] **Issue lifecycle: mark in-review** — run `gh issue edit 712 --add-label "in-review" --remove-label "in-progress"`. Then move the project item to the status column semantically matching "In Review" via `gh project item-edit` (same project/field/option discovery as the in-progress lifecycle step above; warn and skip if not found).
- [ ] Wait 60 seconds for CI to start
- [ ] Spawn a sub-agent to run `pr-review-toolkit:review-pr`; address all findings (commit, push, re-run) until zero findings remain. If findings persist after three or more iterations with no progress, report the stall with remaining findings listed and wait for human guidance before continuing.
- [ ] **Enable auto-merge only after the review gate passes (zero findings):** `gh pr merge <PR-URL> --auto --squash` (repo ruleset only allows squash merges — never `--merge`; NEVER use `--admin` to force the merge)
- [ ] **Iterate until merged** — repeat the following priority loop continuously until `gh pr view <PR-URL> --json state` returns `MERGED`; if it returns `CLOSED` exit and notify the user — never wait for a human to report the merge; never force-merge:
  1. **Build and tests** — run all steps in [Remote push validation]; fix any failures, commit, and push before doing anything else in this iteration
  2. **PR comments** — poll `gh pr view <PR-URL> --json reviewThreads`; for every unresolved thread, address the feedback, reply, resolve the thread via the `resolveReviewThread` GraphQL mutation, commit fixes, run [Remote push validation], push, wait 180 seconds; continue until all threads are resolved
  3. **CI check failures** — only after all comments are resolved, poll `gh pr checks <PR-URL> --json isRequired,state`; fix any failing required checks, commit, run [Remote push validation], push, wait 180 seconds; then restart this loop from step 1

After every push, restart at step 1. Never skip the build/test gate before pushing any fix.

Ownership metadata:

- Implementer: agent (this change), attributed to doug@dougis.com
- Reviewer(s): `pr-review-toolkit:review-pr` sub-agent (automated); human reviewer per repo branch protection
- Required approvals: per repo branch protection rules for `main`

Blocking resolution flow:

- CI failure → fix → commit → validate locally → push → re-run checks
- Security finding → remediate → commit → validate locally → push → re-scan
- Review comment → address → reply → resolve thread → commit → validate locally → push → confirm resolved

## Post-Merge

- [ ] `git checkout main` and `git pull --ff-only` (from the primary checkout, not the worktree)
- [ ] Verify the merged changes appear on `main`
- [ ] Mark all remaining tasks as complete (`- [x]`)
- [ ] Update repository documentation impacted by the change — none expected beyond this change's own artifacts (no README/CLAUDE.md content references `useRollSubmission`'s internal validation behavior)
- [ ] Sync approved spec deltas into `openspec/specs/roll-submission-validation/spec.md`: append the ADDED requirement "Client hook mirrors server-side roll-submission validation" from this change's `specs/roll-submission-validation/spec.md` into the archived global spec, and update its relative links — replace `../../design.md` with `../../changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-wire-roll-validator-client-712/design.md`
- [ ] Archive the change: move `openspec/changes/wire-roll-validator-client-712/` to `openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-wire-roll-validator-client-712/` and stage both the new location and the deletion of the old location in a single commit
- [ ] Confirm `openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-wire-roll-validator-client-712/` exists and `openspec/changes/wire-roll-validator-client-712/` is gone
- [ ] **Create a doc branch** for the archive and spec updates: `git checkout -b doc/archive-YYYY-MM-DD-wire-roll-validator-client-712` then `git push -u origin doc/archive-YYYY-MM-DD-wire-roll-validator-client-712`
- [ ] Open a PR from `doc/archive-YYYY-MM-DD-wire-roll-validator-client-712` to `main` with title `docs: archive wire-roll-validator-client-712 (YYYY-MM-DD)` — do NOT push directly to `main`
- [ ] **IMMEDIATELY** enable auto-merge on the doc PR: `gh pr merge <DOC-PR-URL> --auto --squash` (NEVER use `--admin`)
- [ ] Monitor the doc PR until it merges (same loop as the implementation PR — address comments and CI failures, push to the same doc branch, repeat)
- [ ] Remove the change's dedicated worktree: `git worktree remove .worktrees/wire-roll-validator-client-712`
- [ ] Prune merged local branches: `git fetch --prune` and `git branch -D wire-roll-validator-client-712 doc/archive-YYYY-MM-DD-wire-roll-validator-client-712`

Required cleanup after archive: `git fetch --prune` and `git branch -D wire-roll-validator-client-712 doc/archive-YYYY-MM-DD-wire-roll-validator-client-712`
